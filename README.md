# MinerMod
Code for Miner Mod. Not sure if I'll keep this updated. Literally just uploading the .cs files as they currently is on my computer (a testing build). I would've also included the assets for the mod but github was giving me a hard time so I decided this is sufficient. DM me @Gnome4777 if you want the assets.

Since the names for the .cs are a bit of a mess

Survivor.cs is the main plugin class

DrillBreak = CrackHammer
Vault = Cave In
Cleave = Timed Explosive
The names were from when I was trying to implement the kit fuu came up with. Over time they developed into such different moves I changed the names in case fuu ever wanted to make his own mod.

Maybe sometime in the future when work on the mod is finished I'll update these and add comments.
